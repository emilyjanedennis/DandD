```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## R Markdown

The purpose of this project is to figure out how I want to do two things:
1. generate a node-based structure for interpersonal interactions in fantasy context
2. generate 5-tiered descriptions of individuals within these networks

1. node generation would include
village:  50-300
town:     1000-8000 (median 2500)
city      8000-1200 (median 10000)

to start, will play with villages


```{r one}

```

```{r two}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
