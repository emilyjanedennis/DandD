```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## R Markdown

The purpose of this project is to figure out how I want to do two things:
1. generate a node-based structure for interpersonal interactions in fantasy context
2. generate 5-tiered descriptions of individuals within these networks

1. ideally, this would be used for:
  a. largest: 1000-1500 people made up of subdistricts
      subdistrict size would be
  b. smallest: ~50 people (~10 families)

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
